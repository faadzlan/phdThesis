@article{Gomez-Ortega2019b,
abstract = {Guard cables, also named ground cables, protect the overhead power lines from electrical discharges that occur during storms. They are installed above the power conductor and therefore, they are the highest cable installed. In some places they are provided with beacon spheres that are visible indicators used for identifying the overhead power lines, to warn low flying airplanes and helicopters of the obstructions. A new transverse aeroelastic instability that appears in guard cables with beacons when excited by a longitudinal wind (TILoW for short) has recently been reported to us. In some cases, a vertical or horizontal oscillatory motion takes place, whereas in other cases the beacon centers follow circular orbits placed also in the transverse plane, while each beacon follows the motion but remaining parallel to itself. The centers of the orbits seem to be close to the static equilibrium position of the guard cable catenary. This whirling motion can be identified as a kind of autorotation. In this work the instability is described, and vortex induced vibration (VIV) is suggested as a candidate responsible for the aerodynamic force exciting the oscillation modes. For the whirling (also could be denoted “revolving”) mode a parallel investigation is ongoing. In order to clarify the problem, a model of the elastic configuration that is excited by the aerodynamic loads is analyzed, the eigenmodes and eigenvalues are presented, and a preliminary order of magnitude assessment of the field data is performed. Frequencies and mode shapes derived from the elastic model and those from the video sequences are found to be in agreement. The oscillation results are compatible with the existence of an alternating force produced by vortex shedding from the sphere. Unfortunately, the assessment could not be pursued further due to the absence of data on the wind speed during the reported sequences. A simplified model of the cable with only one beacon (a swinging sphere) has been tested in a low speed wind tunnel, and the main modes (VIV oscillation and whirling autorotation) have been reproduced and characterized.},

@article{Raghavan2011,
abstract = {Vortex induced vibration (VIV) of circular cylinders is widely accepted as depending weakly on Reynolds number (Re) and strongly on reduced velocity, mass ratio, and damping. Experiments are conducted in the regime right before transition from laminar to turbulent flow (high-Reynolds 2×l04−4×l04<Re<3.5×l05−6×l06) in the Low Turbulence Channel at the University of Michigan. Limited experimental data are available in that regime. This research was initiated in 2004 studying high-damping VIV to convert hydrokinetic energy from ocean/river currents to electricity using the VIVACE Converter. The following experimental observations are made: low and high Reynolds VIV significantly differ. The range of synchronization of the upper branch increases with increase in Reynolds number. Amplitude ratio (A/D) increases with Reynolds number within the upper branch. For high-Reynolds, A/D=1.9 is achieved routinely in spite of high damping. The lower branch disappears, overtaken by extended upper branch. High-Reynolds VIV enters into the 2P domain in the Williamson–Roshko (W–R) map beginning with the initial branch. Hysteresis is not observed in these experiments possibly because parameters remain in the 2P-domain. High Reynolds numbers have a stronger influence than mass ratio on A/D. High-damping high-Reynolds VIV amplitudes are double of those predicted by the modified Griffin plot by extrapolation.},
